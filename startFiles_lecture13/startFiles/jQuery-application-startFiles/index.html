                A chip with 64-bit architecture. An identity sensor for fingerprints. 
                A better and faster camera. And an operating system designed for 64-bit
                architecture. A smartphone with one of these features would already be quite innovative. 				
                Combine all these features and you'll have an iPhone that's ahead of its time.
