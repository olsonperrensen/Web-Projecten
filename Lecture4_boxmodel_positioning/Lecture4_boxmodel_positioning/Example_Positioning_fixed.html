    Belgium (French: Belgique, German: Belgien), officially the Kingdom
    Belgium, is a Western European state bordered by the North Sea to the west,
    The Netherlands in the north, Germany in the east, Luxembourg in the southeast and
    France in the south.
  </p>
  <p>
    Belgium is made up of three communities: the Dutch-speaking, the
    French-speaking and the German-speaking.
    Belgium is divided into three regions: Flemish, Walloon and German
    and the Brussels-Capital Region.
  </p>
  <p>
    The capital is Brussels, which is also the capital of Flanders and the
    administrative centre of the European Union.
  </p>
  <p>
    The name "Belgae" was first mentioned by Julius Caesar,
    but the state of Belgium didn't become independent from the Netherlands until 1830.
