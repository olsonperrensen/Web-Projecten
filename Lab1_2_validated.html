        <h1>This is a centered heading of level 1.</h1>
            <p class="n1">This is an ordinary paragraph. 
            The text is therefore placed against the left margin. 
            If the dimensions of the browser windows are changed, 
            the text will adjust itself automatically.</p>
            <p class="n2">This text will be alligned against the right margin. 
            It reads less plesant, 
            a reason why this type of alignment is not used very often.</p>
