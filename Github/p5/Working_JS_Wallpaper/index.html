                  <strong>SUMMER I AND SUMMER II TERMS</strong>
                  <hr>    
                  <p class="sidep">Based on continued guidance from local health agencies and the CDC, Summer I term (May 11-June 26) and Summer II term (June 29-August 14) will be offered online or via alternative delivery format with the exception of clinically-based professional programs for mid-to-late summer lab-intensive courses.  Community-based educational experiences such as internships, practicums, service learning, fieldwork, etc. can continue; however, the viability of these particular offerings will be contingent on public mandates regarding social distancing and the availability of our educational partners in these efforts. Students are encouraged to contact their admissions counselor or department/faculty contacts with questions regarding the status of community-based educational experiences.</p>
