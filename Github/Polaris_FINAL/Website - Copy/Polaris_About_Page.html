            SHOW US YOUR TASTE Are you prone to punk? mainstream rock? or maybe
            a deliberate fan of Frederic Chopin. In the end, it doesn't even
            matter. As long as you have, through legal means, adquired an audio
            file copy of your desired song, it is all good. Polaris will do the
            rest. If you hesitate whether your file is supported or,
            unfortunately enough, not supported, you should better check the
            Frequently Asked Questions for further information on the topic. Or
            you can go right away by clicking the last available button on this
            webpage.

            EXPRESS YOURSELF We all love when the party you are in gets more and
            more interesting. With Polaris, the same thing happens. It gets
            better with time. We may have as well dedicate ourselves to
            cultivating wine. Back to the features, there are currently four
            supported ways of seeing what you are hearing. That sounds amazing,
            doesn't it? You can see which of the visualizers suits best your
            so-well-developed taste. If you put a heavy song, either you will
            like your CPU working at a more intense rate or you would like to
            see a complete round-up of all frequencies being represented in
            different shapes, colors, sizes and lengths. Just a tip, you can
            actually try this out by downloading something called a "full-sweep"
            or frequency sweeping. This will give you the idea what happens when
            all bands are active. But please don't blast it over your speakers,
            such files can be amplitude inducing and may cause harm at high
            volume rates.

            ENJOY THE MOMENT Once the show is over... it is not really over!
            You can keep the end result of how your song looked like with
            our brand-new, flagship, latest, most aclaimed visualizer of the
            spectrum (no pun intended), the last one. Simply right click it
            once the song is over so you can either see it fullscreen on a new
            web browser tab, and if you like it, save it along with other files
            you may have in your drive. You can set the end result as your
            default wallpaper the moment you log in. Or you can paint it as 
            a work of art, it is up to you! Talking about enjoying the moment, 
            your privacy is also safe with us. You can stay in our site for
            whenever you needed and we will not be tracking you, since we don't use cookies.
