          <strong>ABOUT ME</strong>
          <hr />
          <p class="sidep">
            Based on continuous interest on computers, I Maximiliano Iturria
            Cardozo (born August 30 - 2000) am the one behind the scenes. I will
            be offering you an online or alternative solution for playing audio
            files. My field of study is Artificial Intelligence and I currently
            am in the second semester. The availability of an audio player (with
            features out of the conventional) freely available to anyone with
            internet access makes it possible for possible educational partners
            to use Polaris as a help tool in these efforts. Students are
            encouraged to try the Demonstration page, along with the F.A.Q (or
            Frequently Asked Questions) with questions regarding the status of
            the audio player, visualizer, spectogram and other additional
            features. I wish you a pleaseant experience.

          <strong>PROPEL YOUR LIFE</strong>

            You're a dreamer. But also a doer. And now you're considering
            investing a part of your day to try the antidote of Spotify. Polais
            is a great place to do what you have to do, play audio files and see
            how they would look like based on a series of visualizations. If you
            are unexposed to spectograms, this may seem completely new to you. I
            have designed Polaris to fit your busy life, offering evening,
            weekend, and any-time playability for many of the commonly supported
            audio files.

          <strong>HOW POLARIS WAS MADE</strong>
          <hr />
          <p class="sidep">
            Basically it is a combination of what every modern webpage is made
            out of, and that is HTML for the structural part of it, CSS for the
            styling part of it, and JavaScript for the interactive `real-time`
            part of it. I have incorporated an additional tool in order for
            JavaScript to react to audio more cohesively, and that is a Framework
            called P5.js
