          <strong>MY STORY</strong>
          <hr />
          <p class="sidep">
              <div class="subsidep">Max Iturria is an independent student, based in Belgium. He
                considers himself to be a creative technologist. He has been around
                computers for over since he was ~12 and doing so academically since
                2020, when he started his studies in Comptuer Science in
                Sint-Katelijne-Waver, Flanders region. His interests are focused on
                full stack web development, extending and designing application
                infrastructure, maintenance, custom integrations and optimizations.</div>
            <div class="subsidep"> Max has been on exchange in Belgium since 2018 and became part of a
                Kempen based volunteering group for international student
                counselling and mutual cultural understanding, along with workshop related
                programs
                in 2019. In his spare time, Max likes to test possible combinations
                of computers and intrinsic human connecting experiences like (but
                not only tied to) music, psychology... </div>
           
            <div class="subsidep">His other educational and
                advocacy efforts include learning languages, spirituality,
                meditation, philosophy and mathematics. Max grew up in Cordoba,
                Argentina and right before reaching adulthood he decided to move to
                Belgium alone. Further topics he considers interesting include
                pedagogical programming, Neuroscience of religion, Neurotechnology,
                Neuroethics. He is a student enthousiast that enjoys talking in
                Spanish, English, Dutch, and his broken French and Italian.</div>

          <hr>
                <span class="spanex">Previous projects Max has made include having done research on whether
                fermentation is a temperature-dependent process in relation
                to the environment it (yeast) grows, finding out how 
                folk music shape different cultures and their sense of community-belonging, among
                other projects.
                Inside the Computer Science world, Max held an Aptoide store
                providing modified binaries for android that reached up to eight millon downloads.
                He also did reverse engineering of APKs and EXEs when he was around thirteen, modified
                integer values using Cheat Engine, tried Wireless Penetration tests, among other projects.
