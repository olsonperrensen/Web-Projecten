	<h2>article 4</h2>
	<p>An irregularity is considered to be any behaviour of a student in the context of an examination which makes it wholly or partially impossible or attempts to make it impossible for him or her to form a correct opinion about the knowledge, insight and/or skills of himself/herself or of other students.</p>The following are considered as irregularities
	<p>Plagiarism is an irregularity consisting of any taking over of the work (ideas, texts, structures, images, plans, ...) from oneself or from others, in identical or slightly modified form and without adequate acknowledgement of the source </p>.
	<p>If an examiner suspects that a student has committed an irregularity at an examination, he shall immediately inform the chairperson of the examination board of the facts. If the responsible lecturer suspects that a student has committed plagiarism, the chairperson of the examination committee will also be informed immediately.</p>
	<p>If the facts are proven, the examination committee may decide whether or not to impose an examination disciplinary sanction for the entire programme of study. Pending a decision by the examination board on a reported irregularity, the student(s) may continue to complete his examinations. The student(s) has the right to be heard before any decision on an irregularity committed. The ombudsperson is invited to attend. The student(e) has the right to inspect the file. He can be assisted by a counsellor during the interrogation.</p>
	<p>The examination board may decide on the following examination disciplinary sanctions:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>a 0/20 on the examination or workpiece of the course unit or part thereof;</li>
		<li>not awarding marks for all examinations in the examination period in question;</li>
   		<li>rejection: the student(s) can register for the next academic year at the earliest. The rejected student loses all examination marks obtained in the examination period in question;</li>.
		<li>exclusion: immediate termination of enrolment in the current academic year and prohibition of enrolment in the next academic year in all participating institutions</li>.
    </ul>

    	<li>earth and extent of the irregularity/plagiarism;</li>
  		<li>the experience of the student;</li>
		<li>the intention to cheat.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>article 5</h2>
    <p>A student has passed a course unit if he/she has obtained at least 10/20 or the assessment "passed". For the calculation of the average over an entire programme of study, the result will be
obtained for a course unit weighted according to the number of credits associated with the course unit. Course units to which a non-numerical assessment has been assigned are not included in the calculation.</p>
	<p>When calculating the average final result, the aggregated results of the student(s) are rounded to the underlying percentage for the decimals 0.1-0.4 and upwards for the decimals 0.5-0.9.</p>.
	<p>A student has passed a programme of study if he/she has obtained a credit certificate or an exemption for all course units of the programme of study.</p>
	<p>The examination committee establishes the total examination result for each student it assesses, with due observance of Articles 13 and 14.</p> During the deliberation, the examination committee establishes the total examination result for each student it assesses.
	<p>The examination board thus decides whether a successful student will receive the following degree of merit:</p>
	<ul>
    	<li>biggest award, from 85%</li>
		<li>big award, from 77%</li>
		<li>award, from 68%</li>
		<li>sufficiently, up to 67%</li>
    </ul>
	<p>For those students whose remaining program has been reduced to less than half of the total study load of the program by virtue of exemptions, the decision of the examination board is limited to a decision on whether or not to pass that remaining part of the program. </p>
